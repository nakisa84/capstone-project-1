Breast Cancer Survival Prediction 

This project was done as the first capstone project in my journey of learning data science in Springboard.
Dataset that has been used here is Seer Breast Cancer Data. This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer diagnosed in 2006-2010.		

Project Steps:			
Data Wrangling - This is where we try to get a raw understanding of what the data looks like and perform transformations and operations on it to bring it to a more usable state		

Exploratory Data Analysis - Here, we try to understand the nature and distribution of our data by plotting visualizations of different features in the dataset. This can give useful insights prior to the modeling phase.

Preprocessing - The stage where we perform any other operations on the data, like scaling or normalizing, before it is ready to be fed into a machine learning model.	

Modeling - The most important part of course, where we actually try fitting different models onto the preprocessed dataset and evaluate which model performs the best	model.
